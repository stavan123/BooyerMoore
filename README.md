# BooyerMoore
program for implementing BooyerMoore
1. The BooyerMooreBadCharHeurastics  contain the Booyer Moore Algorithm implementation using the bad character Heurastics in python.
2. The Plagarism is a application file used to demonstrate the application of Boyer Moore algorithm. The Plagarism detection is a application of Boyer Moore Algo. The percentage of the file that is plagered. If the percentage is greater the 75% then the file is plagered
3 . Steps to execute plagarism.py

  1. Create a directory which contains the files to be texted for plagarism.
  2. Create a patterntext file like we have in our project
  3. Execute the plagarism.py file
    enter the directory <nameof directory>
    enter the patternfile <name of pattern file>
4. Check the Output file for more details
