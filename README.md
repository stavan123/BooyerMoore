Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
Example :
Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
        pat[] = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10

#  2. Pagarism Detection Application of Boyer Moore

Plagarism detection is a application of Boyer Moore Algorithm. The Program takes a directory as input and a pattern file which is compared with the files in the directoy using the Boyer Moore Algorithm. The files in the directory are read one by one and the each of the are compared with the pattern file. After you execute the Plagarism.exe file  then  it outputs the  percentage of the file that is plagered. If the percentage is greater the 75% then it prints that the file is plagered.

Program for implementing  Plagarism Detection.
  Steps to execute 
1. Download the Plagarism.exe file or you can download and clone the whole project.
2. Simple run the Plagarism.exe file
3. Select the folder containing the file to be checked for plagariam by clicking the select folder button.
4. Select the pattern file by clicking the select pattern file button.
5. Click the check button to get the result.
