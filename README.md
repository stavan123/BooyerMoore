#  1. BooyerMoore
Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
Program for simple Boyer moore using BadCharacter Heurastics.
The BooyerMooreBadCharHeurastics.py  contain the Booyer Moore Algorithm implementation using the bad character Heurastics in python.

Example :
Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
        pat[] = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10

#  2. Pagarism Detection Application of Boyer Moore
Program Logic
Plagarism detection is a application of Boyer Moore Algorithm. The Program takes a directory as input and a pattern file which is compared with the files in the directoy using the Boyer Moore Algorithm. The files in the directory are read one by one and the each of the are compared with the pattern file. After you execute the Plagarism.py file  then  it outputs the  percentage of the file that is plagered. If the percentage is greater the 75% then it prints that the file is plagered.

Program for implementing  Plagarism Detection.
  Steps to execute plagarism.py

  1. Create a directory which contains the files to be texted for plagarism.
  2. Create a patterntext file like we have in our project
  3. Execute the plagarism.py file
    enter the directory <nameof directory>
    enter the patternfile <name of pattern file>
  4. Check the Output file for more details
